## Email Feedback Configuration

The app includes a feedback widget that allows users to send feedback directly via email. To enable this feature:

### Setting Up SMTP

1. **Configure SMTP settings** in your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [smtp]
   host = "your-smtp-server.com"
   port = 587
   user = "your-username"
   password = "your-password"
   from = "sender@example.com"
   to = "feedback@example.com"
   use_tls = true
   ```

2. **Use the provided examples** in `.streamlit/secrets.example.toml` for:
   - **Gmail**: Use App Passwords (not regular password)
   - **Microsoft 365**: Business/enterprise accounts
   - **SendGrid**: Reliable third-party service

### Testing Your Configuration

1. Visit the **Email Diagnostics** page in the app sidebar
2. Check your configuration status
3. Send a test email to verify everything works
4. Review any error messages and helpful troubleshooting hints

### Security Notes

- Never commit real credentials to source control
- Use environment variables or Streamlit Cloud secrets for production
- For Gmail, use App Passwords instead of your regular password
- Ensure your SMTP provider allows the configured sender address
